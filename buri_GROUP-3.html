<h3> Buri History</h3>

<p>Buri (Corypha Elata) is the largest palm endemic in the Philippines.Buri palm trees are naturally growing in Batangas Province. Many handicrafts are produced using buri palm from Batangas, especially in Lobo like bags, baskets, hats, among others and even in Ilocos Sur the use of buri palm parts have been considered. In addition, Pakaskas or buri palm sugar is also one of the products made from buri sap but is produced in small quantity only, since no added value has been realized for this palm sugar aside for snacks and sweetening. According to Office of the City Veterinarian and Agricultural Service (OCVAS 2010) there are almost 5700 buri trees in Batangas Province, mostly found in the communities located at Verde Island and Lobo.</p>

<p>Weaving originated during pre-colonial times. This unique industry has been handed down from one generation to the other. Buri weaving is an important part of the culture and history of Tobias Fornier, Antique. This industry is already part of the identity of the inhabitants of Barangay Diclum. Buri weaving should continually be valued because of its strong historical worth.</p>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<p>Part 1.</p>
<p>1. Put one strip over the other, making an 'X' in the middle.</p>
<p>2. Wrap one strip (Purple will be Strip 1) over the other one (Blue will be the Strip 2), forming a V.</p>
<p>3. From the right, fold Strip 2 over Strip 1 and then slip it underneath, creating the beginnings of your weave.</p>
<p>4. Pull and press to tighten and flatten the paper.</p>
<p>5. Flip it the whole thing so that the loose ends are facing away from you.In effect, you now have four strips to continue the weave (two each from Strips 1 and 2). Let's label them A, B, C, and D from left to right.</p>

<p>part 2</p>
<p>1. Get D, the rightmost strip.</p>
<p>2. Transfer to the left side and fold between A and B.</p>
<p>3. Now take A, the leftmost strip, and bring it between B and C.</p>
<p>4. Pull and press to tighten and flatten the paper.</p>

<p>part3</p>
<p>1. From here, we again grab the rightmost strip.</p>
<p>2. Twist and fold to lay flat on top of the strip beside it.</p>
<p>3. Fold the middle strip to the front like the picture above.</p>
<p>4. Take the leftmost strip, then twist and fold it towards the right.</p>
<p>5. Remember the middle strip you folded down? Flip it right back up. </p>
<p>6. Press to tighten and flatten the paper.</p>
<p>7. Repeat the process until your desired length or until the strips of paper run out.</p>

<p><strong>process:</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: Prepare the Buri Leaves
Collect fresh buri palm leaves and let them dry under the sun for a few days until they are light and flexible.
Soak the dried leaves in water for a few hours to make them pliable if they have stiffened.Cut the leaves into uniform strips, around 1–2 cm wide.</p>
    
<p>Step 2: Create the Base (Crown)
Take several strips and form a circular base, measuring the desired circumference of the hat.
Begin weaving the strips using a basic under-over technique, creating a flat circular pattern.
Adjust the tightness of the weave to ensure the base is sturdy and even.Once the desired size of the crown is reached, secure the edges by folding and tucking the ends into the weave.
    
<p>Step 3: Weave the Sides
From the edges of the base, extend the weaving pattern upward to form the sides of the hat.
Use additional strips as needed, tucking them into the weave securely.Maintain an even slope or straight sides, depending on your design.Continue weaving upward until the desired height of the crown is achieved.</p>

<p>Step 4: Create the Brim
Extend the weaving outward from the bottom edge of the crown to form the brim.Use longer strips for the brim to ensure it is wide and sturdy.Weave in a circular pattern, gradually increasing the diameter by adding strips as needed.Check the brim for evenness and adjust the weave if necessary.</p>

<p>Step 5: final step
Trim any excess buri strips to clean up the hat's edges.Reinforce weak spots by threading additional strips into the weave or sewing with a needle and thread. Shape the hat by bending and molding the brim and crown to your preference while the material is still pliable. Let the hat dry completely to set its shape.</p>

<p><strong>process:</strong></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>You can collect the coconut leaves known as fronds from a large branch from the tree. we need about 10 to 12 pieces of these fronds.</p>

<p>•Pull away the fronds from the branch.</p>
<p>•Now you have 2 leaflets from one frond.</p>

<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>•Place required number of leaflets side by side on the floor (9, 10 or 11 to the required size).</p>
<p>•Take another leaflet and weave through leaflets on the floor in an above and below pattern.</p>
<p>•Continue adding leaflets till the numbers on both sides are equal.</p>
<p>•You can also add more leaflets on both sides to make it larger.</p>

<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>•If you look at the partly woven mat at this stage, you will find the extra length of leaves in an above and below position.</p>
<p>•First take the leaflets at one side which are below and fold them over the end leaf.</p>
<p>•Insert the folded portion through other leaflets in perpendicular in the same pattern as above and below.</p>
<p>•Trim end of leaflets protruding through. Do this for all four sides.</p>

<p>Step 4:</p>
<p>•Now turn over the mat and repeat same we did on the other side, like folding extra length and inserting ends through the leaflets in perpendicular.</p>
<p>•Trim all extra length of leaflets and our mat is finished.</p>

<p><strong>process:</strong></p>
<p>1. Make the base of the basket. You'll need to lay out 5 reeds parallel to one another, with about 3/8ths of a space between them. Weave a sixth reed perpendicularly through the other 5. Bring the sixth reed over the first reed, under the second, over the third, under the fourth and over the fifth reed. Weave 4 more reeds in this manner, making sure that they are parallel to the sixth reed. Ensure that the squares formed by the base weaving are no bigger than 3/8 inch (.9 cm).</p>

<p>2.Bend the reeds. Bend the reeds that stick out from the square base into an upwards position. These bent reeds are called spokes. Bending them will make it easier to weave and these spokes will act as the supports for the basket.</p>

<p>3.Split a center spoke. Split one end of either the third or eighth spoke, starting where it comes out from under the last spoke to cross it. You will now have eleven spokes. You'll be putting the weaver into the split.</p>

<p>4. Weave the basket. Put the tapered end (the smaller end) of a weaver reed into the split spoke and hold it in place with a clothespin. Keep the weaver reed near the base of the basket and weave, by going over one spoke and under the next.</p>
<p>•If you're going for a square shape, hold the base corners together with clothespins. This will help maintain the shape of the base.</p>
<p>•Continue to attach and weave new reeds through the spokes for 3 or 4 rows, depending on the desired height of the basket. Each new reed should be stacked above the reed woven before it.</p>
<p>•Do your best to make the weave snug and tight, but not too tight or you can screw up the base of the basket. You, also, want to make sure that the weave isn't too loose.</p>

<p>5. Foot the base. This means closing up those square holes that are still in the base. Starting in the left corner of your basket, take the corner spoke and tug it gently. Tug more firmly on the second spoke. You want to tug quite firmly on the middle spoke because this will create an arch in the bottom of the basket. Move to the 4th spoke and tug gently again.</p>
<p>Straighten your spokes and repeat on all 4 sides of the basket, until the holes in the base are closed.</p>
<p>6.Continue weaving. Keep attaching and weaving new reeds through the spokes. Make sure that you don't pull too hard on the corners, because that will make your spokes bend inward and you'll lose your basket's shape.</p>
<p>You also don't want your corners to be too loose, which can happen if you aren't keeping your spokes upright and parallel while you weave.</p>
<p>Stop weaving once you've reached your desired height.</p>

<p>7.Pack the base. Push or pull the woven rows down towards the base as you weave. Ensure that there is no space between the base and the rows. Start pressing or pulling from the base and move up to the newer reeds as you go.</p>
<p>•A properly packed basket should have a nicely arched base, straight, parallel spokes, properly spaced corners, and tight weaver rows.</p>
    
<p>8. Finish the top of the basket. Stop weaving your last reed after you have woven 4 spokes past the split spoke. Taper the reed with scissors, moving from the fourth spoke to the end of the reed. Weave until all of the final reed has been woven into the spokes.</p>
    
<p>9. Trim the basket. Cut the spokes with scissors. The spokes should be 1/2 to 2 inches (1.3 to 5 cm) higher than the last woven reed. Fold the spokes towards the inside of the basket over the top row of reeds. Insert the end of each spoke into the third row from the top. Ensure that each spoke lies flat against the inside of the basket.</p>

<p>10. Make the rim. You'll wrap a reed around the top row of the basket and pin it to the basket with a clothespin. Now, anchor the new reed by weaving its bottom end into the top few rows inside the basket. This reed is called the lacer.</p>
<p>•Bring the lacer up and over the reed pinned to the basket and insert it through the front of the basket into the woven rows. Now pull the lacer inside the basket.</p>
<p>•Continue wrapping the lacer around the pinned reed, circling the circumference of the basket.</p>
<p>•Glue the end of the lacer inside the basket.</p>

<p><strong>process:</strong></p>
<p>1. Prepare the Buri Leaves.</p>
<p>- Soak the dried buri palm leaves in water to make them soft and easy to work with.</p>
<p>- Once pliable, trim the edges to make uniform strips of the same width.</p>
    
<p>2.Start the Weaving.</p>
<p>- Take a few strips and lay them out in a crisscross pattern to form a base for the bag.</p>
<p>- Weave the strips over and under each other tightly to create a sturdy bottom.</p>
<p>- Secure the ends by folding and tucking them back into the weave or tying a knot.</p>

<p>3.Build the Sides.</p>
<p>- Add more strips vertically from the edges of the base.</p>
<p>- Weave horizontally around these vertical strips in an over-under pattern, moving upwards to form the bag’s walls.</p>
<p>- Adjust as needed to maintain the bag’s shape.</p>

<p>4. Finish the Edges.</p>
<p>- Once you’ve reached the desired height, fold the top edges of the strips inward and secure them.</p>
<p>- Use thread to stitch the edges together or glue them for extra strength.</p>
    
<p>5. Attach the Handles </p>
<p>- For handles, braid extra buri strips or use pre-made handles.</p>
<p>- Sew or glue them securely to the bag at two opposite points.</p>

<p>6. Final Touches.</p>
<p>- Check for loose ends and trim or tuck them neatly.</p>
<p>- Let the bag dry completely if it was damp during the process.</p>
<p>- You can decorate it with beads, paint, or other materials if desired.</p>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<p>1. Harvest the Buri Palm Leaves</p>
<p>Carefully select mature Buri palm leaves. They are typically long and wide, with a natural fan shape.</p>
<p>Trim the leaf off the palm using a knife or scissors, making sure to leave a section of the stem that will serve as the fan's handle.</p>

<p>2. Prepare the Leaves</p>
<p>If the Buri palm leaves are too large, you may want to cut them into more manageable pieces.</p>
<p>Rinse the leaves to remove dirt and debris. Then, let them dry out a bit, but they should still be flexible when you begin working with them.</p>

<p>3. Flatten the Leaves</p>
<p>Buri palm leaves can be stiff when dried. You might need to soak them briefly in water to make them more pliable.</p>
<p>Once soft, gently flatten the leaves using your hands or a rolling pin, but don’t press too hard to avoid breaking the fibers.</p>

<p>4. Create the Fan Shape</p>
<p>Depending on the desired fan size, take one or two large leaves and cut them into a rectangular or oval shape.</p>
<p>For a rounded fan, you can trim the edges of the leaves into a semi-circular or fan-like shape.</p>

<p>5. Weave the Leaves (Optional).</p>
<p>To create a more intricate design, you can weave several strips of the palm leaves together. This adds texture and makes the fan more durable.</p>
<p>Cut the leaves into long, narrow strips, then weave them in a basic over-under pattern to create a grid or mesh effect. This part is optional, as you can use the whole leaf as it is.</p>
    
<p>6. Attach the Handle</p>
<p>Once you have your fan's desired shape, take the thickest part of the palm leaf (near the stem) and attach it as a handle.</p>
<p>If the stem isn’t long enough, you can use a bamboo skewer or stick. Secure it with strong glue or by threading it through a hole you’ve made in the base of the leaf.</p>
<p>For added security, you can tie the handle with some string or twine.</p>

<p>7. Trim and Refine</p>
<p>Trim any rough edges on the fan with scissors to create a neat, uniform look.</p>
<p>If you want, you can also use a needle and thread to stitch some parts of the fan for extra strength, especially where the leaf joins the handle.</p>

<p>8. Dry and Harden</p>
<p>Let the fan dry completely if it’s still damp, and ensure the handle is securely fastened.</p>
<p>Once it’s fully dry, the fan should be rigid enough for use.</p>

<p>9. Decorate (Optional)</p>
<p>If desired, you can decorate your fan with paint, dye, or additional decorative touches. Traditional fans might include hand-painted designs, but you can keep it simple or add your unique flair.</p>

<p>Final Tips:</p>
<p>Make sure to work slowly and carefully to avoid breaking the delicate fibers of the Buri palm leaf.</p>
<p>You can create a decorative pattern by cutting the leaves into thinner strips or curling them before attaching them to the fan’s base.</p>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<p>STEP 1: Tools Required</p>
<p>You need a machete or any such tool to trim the leaflets from the fronds, and a knife to separate the broom sticks from the leaflets. A garden shear will also come in handy to trim the end of the broom, otherwise you can also use the machete for this.</p>
    
<p>STEP 2: Collect Coconut Tree fronds</p>
<p>if you have a coconut tree in your backyard, you can collect the fronds from the tree.The bottom-most branches which are turning a little yellow may be trimmed from the tree. To make a broom of suitable size, leaflets from about three fronds are required.</p>

<p>STEP 3: Trim and Collect Leaflets.</p>
<p>Using a machete, trim the leaflets from the fronds. Collect these leaflets and store in a place where it will be comfortable to work.</p>

<p>STEP 4: Make Broom Sticks</p>
<p>Take a leaflet and insert the knife between the mid-rib and the greens</p>
<p>Shear with the knife along the mid-rib to separate the greens</p>
<p>The remaining greens can be pulled down with hands</p>
<p>There may be a thin layer of greens attached to the mid-rib. Using the knife remove these strands also from the sticks.</p>
<p>The last photograph shows few of the broom sticks separated from the leaflets</p>

<p>STEP 5: Tie Sticks Together</p>
<p>Now we got enough sticks to make a broom.</p>
<p>Take all sticks together and level the bottom of the broom against a hard surface</p>
<p>Tie the broom with a piece of coir rope and trim extra rope</p>

<p>STEP 6: Trim Ends and Finish</p>
<p>Once the bottom of the broom is leveled and tied together, you can trim the sweeping end to make it uniform.</p>
<p>Hold the sweeping end tightly with your hand</p>
<p>Using a garden shear, trim away the unwanted portion of broom. You can also place this end over a piece of wood and trim using a machete</p>
<p>Now your Broom made with coconut tree leaves is ready.</p>

<p>STEP 7: Uses for the Remains</p>
<p>The remaining material after removing the broom sticks are biodegradable. In rural areas, people use them as fuel for cooking and heating water. You can use them to make vermi-compost combining with cow dung. These material also serve as mulch provided around plants and trees to keep the soil moist.</p>

<p> A native delicacy made of buri sap from Batangas. Although it is extremely sweet and sinful for some, people in Verde Island believed that this won’t cause them diabetes. Buri palm sap is harvested and cooked for hours until it thickens and caramelizes. The liquified sugar is then placed in circular containers made of dried buri palm leaves, called casitas, and left to solidify. The canisters are stacked and tied together using buri palm string, making the entire package completely biodegradable. A 2016 study of pakaskas noted that out of the six barangays on Isla Verde, four are engaged in pakaskas production. Pakaskas can be eaten on its own like candy, but the deep caramel flavor provides a complexity that pairs well with kakanin like suman.</p>

<p> Similar to pakaskas is the Illongo delicacy, kalamay sa buri, which is noted to be eaten more as a dessert than used as a sweetener. A more detailed observation records the steps in making this sugar. First, buri palm is tapped and sap is extracted usually from the hours of 3pm to 9am at six-hour intervals. This process is called dawat. After each interval, the collected sap is boiled to prevent spoilage. After the day’s collection is finished, the entire batch is boiled again for 3-4 hours until it reaches a dark, sticky consistency. At this stage it is known as pulot or jam. Like its Batagueño cousin, the finished product is then stored in a container made of dried buri leaves called pinadakan.</p>

<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>

<p>To make Kalamay sa Buri, the tuba is collected daily until generous amount is stored. It is then pre-heated to remove excess water and to "pasteurize" the buri sap. </p>
<p>Now comes the actual cooking, the juice is then boiled for around 4 hrs until it thickens and resembles "muscovado" sugar.</p>
